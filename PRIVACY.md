# Privacy Policy for KnoxLink

Last updated: 21-03-2025

## Introduction

KnoxLink is a browser extension that adds a button to Steam Workshop pages for Project Zomboid mods, allowing users to import mods directly to KnoxKit.

## No Data Collection

**KnoxLink does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data.**

The extension operates entirely within your browser and only:
- Identifies if you're on a Project Zomboid mod page
- Extracts the mod ID from the current URL
- Adds an "Import with KnoxKit" button
- Creates a knoxkit:// protocol URL when the button is clicked

## Permissions

KnoxLink only requests access to specific Steam Workshop URLs to function properly:
- `*://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/*`
- `*://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/*`

These permissions are used solely to detect when you're viewing a Project Zomboid mod and to add the import button.

## Third-Party Services

KnoxLink does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we update our privacy policy, we will post the new policy here and update the "last updated" date.
